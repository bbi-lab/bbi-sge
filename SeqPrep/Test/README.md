You can run `./RUNTEST.sh` from this directory to run some tests on a real dataset. Alternatively in the ./SimTest folder there is another `./RUNTEST.sh` that will execute a variety of parameters (edit the file to change which parameters are tried) and output an HTML plot of sensitivity vs specificity for each of the parameters. The different points on the plot are labeled with the settings used to generate that point when you go over it with the mouse. I primarily used that test file along with things I have seen in real datasets to generate the current default settings.
